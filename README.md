# Arduino plugin for MADS

This is a source plugin for MADS that reads a JSON string published by an Arduino connected via serial port on the MADS network.

## Installation

Linux and MacOS:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$(mads -p)"
cmake --build build -j4
cmake --install build
```

Windows:

```powershell
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$(mads -p)"
cmake --build build --config Release
cmake --install build --config Release
```

## INI settings

The plugin supports the following settings in the INI file:

```ini
[arduino]
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
baudrate = 115200
silent = true
connection_timeout = 5000
# the following can be omitted; if so, it is not used at all
cfg_cmd = ""
```

All settings are optional; if omitted, the default values are used.

## Executable demo

The test main takes two alternative arguments: the path (or name, on Windows) to the serial port, or the `-e`, which enumerates all available ports and exits.

## Arduino code

The `arduino` folder contains a sketch that can be customized to read different analog or digital pin and publish a corresponding JSON string on serial port.

The script supports a simple command parsing interface that allows to configure some settings on the Arduino side. Look at the arduino code for details, but this allows to set the `cfg_cmg` setting as `250p20t`, for example, to set the sampling period to 250 ms and the threshold to 20 (in the range 0â€“1023).
